# Chalenges

### 1. A filterable contact list [[DEMO](filerable_contacts_list.gif)]

**It should:**
- Filterable. When filter, string matches the search term should have different color.
- Group by the first character of contact's name.
- Capable of rendering a thousand contact.

**Notes:**
- You can use [this package](https://github.com/rt2zz/react-native-contacts) to get contact from native.
- No specified tool. You can use [ListView](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/releases/next/docs/listview.html) or any package provided by community. (Or even the new shining toy: [SectionList](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/releases/next/docs/sectionlist.html))
- No fancy UI needed.

### 2. Animation

Implement this animation with React Native. DEMO:

Based on `Code in the Dark` fronend challenge.

**Notes:**

No limit. Free you mind. You can create animation with Adobe After Effect and implement in React Native by using [Lottie](http://airbnb.design/lottie/). Why not?
